LEVANTE: Learning Variability Network Exchange – Information for Steering Committee Members
1.	Background 
Variability is a common denominator during childhood. Children show highly variable abilities and skills at many different levels. At the within subject level, they might have a superb memory capacity but need some time to fully process new information. Furthermore, these capacities might change not only with development, but also on much shorter timescales: they are able to learn a new mathematical concept really fast one day, but seem to have forgotten it the next day or even the very same afternoon. 
Variability is also commonplace at the groups level. In the classroom, groups are usually integrated by children who despite their similar biological age, might show highly heterogenous capacities. Yet education systems are not designed to address children’s variable states, often offering inflexible instruction that does not fit the needs of most children at a given time. In addition, differences between contexts (i.e. contextual variability) might facilitate or deter the outcomes of the different learning experiences children are exposed to on a daily basis.
In research, dominant methods still favor group averages, short snapshots of time, and single environments. When learning variability is acknowledged, researchers disagree about its origins, how to address it, and when to embrace or reduce it. Similarly, there is a lack of data and scientific evidence on the interplay between the different variability dimensions. Such evidence would facilitate our understanding on why certain learning solutions might work for some individuals but not for others, or why this might happen in specific groups or contextual circumstances. If research fully embraces learning variability, the resulting knowledge could enable policy makers, designers, and educators to make decisions that serve a greater variety of children, more often, in their early and middle years. By proposing a set of guiding questions on learning variability, the Jacobs Research Agenda aims to shift the focus and contribute to the development of the science of learning variability, building the backbone of a large multidisciplinary and multisectoral community with a focus on learning variability which would work towards improving children’s learning and development globally. The present mechanism LEVANTE will facilitate the implementation of the questions posed by the Jacobs Research Agenda, with the creation of a global network of researchers who will contribute to the development of an open-source dataset focused on the assessments of the different dimensions involved in learning variability and their interplay, including within-subject, within-group, and between-contexts variability.

Traditional longitudinal cohort studies provide a window into variability in children’s development within a single population, but with very high cost and limited flexibility. Previous studies have put the focus either on longitudinal assessment of cognitive and/or brain development, with the goal to investigate child health and development (The Dunedin Study | Moffitt & Caspi: Genes, Environment, Health, Behavior (duke.edu), ManyBabies), potential factors associated to subsequent substance use/abuse (ABCD Study), development of mental health problems (https://eriskstudy.com), or the underlying mechanisms of shared and specific traits in twins (The Texas Twin Project | The Twin Project at the University of Texas (utexas.edu)) to mention some. Other consortia have followed a different approach, gathering pre-existing datasets with data that might be similar to some extent across different research centres to increase their power to answer difficult questions. These datasets might provide information that might be relevant to the field of learning variability and allow for the testing of initial hypothesis however, these are not comprehensive and therefore do not allow to answer crucial questions about the impact and interactions between the different variability dimensions on individual learning outcomes. 
Here we propose a framework for an interrelated set of accelerated, longitudinal studies that use the same sampling plan, data collection platform, core measure set, and data management platform, creating a high-value open dataset for future reuse. A key scientific goal is to understand the nature of both developmental variability and continuity by connecting between constructs measured in early childhood and those studied in school-aged children. In contrast to traditional cohort studies, data collection will be distributed across groups and populations via a call for proposals that allows participating researchers to integrate core elements into new study designs exploring developmental variability across a range of populations.

3.	Methods
The present mechanism will proceed in two phases. The first one will comprise the remaining of 2023, with the second one starting on Q1 2024. At the same time the second phase will be subdivided in two stages. In the initial stage (2024-2027) there will be an annual selection of participating sites by means of a yearly call for project submissions. In addition to this call, during Stage 3 (2028-2030) we will open a second yearly call for proposal, which in this case will focus on conducting secondary analyses on the already collected data. This will multiply the impact of the mechanism by the end of 2030. 

Details on the activities included in each phase are outlined below. Rough budget and timeline specifications are provided in the additional excel template. Released funding for the different tasks/packages will follow recommendations from Steering Committee and be approved by Minds BWG.   
Phase I (2023): 
•	Infrastructure coordinator formally appointed (Prof Michael Frank, Stanford)
•	Formal appointment of the steering committee (SC). Confirmed: Ken Dodge, Nora Newcombe, Bob Siegler, Bob Pianta, Candice Odgers, Hiro Yoshikawa, Maggie Snowling, Sebastian Lipina, Stephanie Carlson. Pending: Sandra Graham. 
•	SC provides recommendation on core assessment measures to be used (in-person meeting at Marbach in Q3 2023)
•	SC to provide recommendations on protocol definitions. call for proposals/participating sites, project evaluation guidelines. 
•	Key decision-making governance body in agreement with JF management and submitting recommendations to BWG for approval
•	Envisioned engagement period: 3 years (tbd). 
•	Development of reliable but flexible infrastructures
•	User end (web based/ app based, etc) accounting for developmental cultural and linguistic heterogeneity
•	Archival repository able to incorporate synchronize different types of data, from different locations etc
•	Clearly delineated data sharing, data release and data access (e.g. gating protocol) to the wider research community 
•	Engagement of scientists on working groups for the detailed develop protocols for data collection, homogenization, curation etc following recommendations of the SC. 
•	Clearly delineate ethical and legal procedures for data anonymization and development of the required consent/assent protocols to facilitate approval from the corresponding Ethical Committees at each participating site.


Phase II: 
Stage 1 (2024-2027)
•	Open call for participating sites/ proposals (Q2 2024)
•	Pre-requisite: administration of core assessments to all participants, in a longitudinal accelerated design 
•	Data collected: core assessments + add-on modules (financial cap tbd)
•	Submissions might be open to individual labs, or represent collaboration between 2 labs/ PIs
•	Dissemination activities: workshops/ symposiums on learning variability topic as well as on LEVANTE access and possibilities
•	2027 Q4: database should be fully open-sourced and available to the wider scientific community.

Stage 2 (2027-2030)
•	Open call for participating sites/ proposals (yearly)
•	Open call for secondary analyses on openly available data 
Continued dissemination activities

4.	 Impact 
The key outcome of the current mechanism will be the creation of a uniquely large, well-curated, high value dataset to be used by researchers for years to come, with the main focus on learning variability. Such contribution will not only facilitate the development of the science of learning variability, but help constitute the backbone of a larger multidisciplinary, multisectoral research community on learning variability working toward improving children’s learning and development globally. Given its longitudinal character, it will furthermore facilitate not only the prediction of individual, child-related outcomes but also generate evidence that can have translational impact in different sectors such as the integration of potential intervention studies or research about the impact of policy changes on learning outcomes. To achieve these goals, it is crucial the precise definition of the mechanism and its evolving nature, which will be determined in Phase I and revised at the end of the first stage of Phase II.
The data will be accessible to the wider scientific community. In order to achieve this, researchers will contribute their data to the common, openly shared database. Data will be stored and saved in an open-access centralized repository. This is particularly the case for the core, common measures that are administered across the different participating sites. The specifics for the additional, individually decided data that belongs to the modular add-ons will be decided in agreement with infrastructure manager/ adviser, steering committee and approved by the board working group.  Given the multifaceted character of the data to be incorporated into the open repository, careful consideration needs to be taken at this point in time to ensure its flexibility, facilitating the integration of multiple types of data (e.g. behavioural, questionnaire, psychophysiological, imaging, video, actigraphy). It will need to comply with ethical and legal requirements in terms of data anonymization.
While still to be agreed upon by the SC, pre-registrations (and whenever possible, registered reports) will most likely be required or strongly encouraged. Similarly, researchers will be required to openly share their analyses code and results to facilitate potential replications of the published evidence. Dissemination activities will not only be conducted via conferences and paper publications but also directly through research societies via workshops, symposia or panel discussion.

5.	Risk Analysis
Key Risk	Mitigation Strategy
Reduced number of applications	Definition of the calls and requirements will take consideration of what the scientific community can and cannot do. Budget for the different types of proposals will take these considerations into account to facilitate wider contribution from an extensive number of labs. 
Database not being used	Relevance of the data will be ensured by recruiting a multidisciplinary SC including not only scientist but also in interaction with key stakeholders to ensure the relevance of the database for translational implementations 
Infrastructure lack flexibility to handle data provided by different researchers 	Careful approach with inclusion of experts with previous experience on multifaceted, large consortiums with enormous demands and requirements. This helps us build on their expertise and save time and resources, making the process most efficient
Irrelevance of measures included in the core assessment battery	Recruitment of experts in each of the different variability dimensions to ensure coordinated agreement on valid, reliable and suitable measures that can be implemented globally
